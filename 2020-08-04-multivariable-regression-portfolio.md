## About this Project

This project is an attempt to more thoroughly understand the content described in the Udemy Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp course.

This project is intended as a portfolio piece.

The project will take the data in the Ames Housing data set, as opposed to the Boston Housing data set, and repeat the steps described in the Udemy course.

The final project will be written in such a manner that it can be displayed as a portfolio piece on my website.
