# Reasoning for Keeping and Deleting Data Types

This document contains the reasoning for keeping or deleting each feature.

## General Reasoning

### Pre-Processing Observations

The following observations are made during the initial breakdown of the data and shows how the analysis approaches the challenge of finding the target price for each indexed property. 

#### Data Refers to Multiple Types

The properties contained in this data set are not uniformly related to each other nor to all contained features.

For example, there are commercial properties, residential properties, agricultural properties, and other types of properties.

Comparing features across all types is not recommended.

The first break down, therefore, is to split each property into subgroups by type.

After each subgroup is analyzed, correlation of features across subgroups can be futher explored.

#### Functional

Properties that are considered `salvage only` or `severely damaged` are likely in a different category than all others.

Bifurcating the data into subgroups along these lines is highly relevant during the early stages of data exploration.

#### Geographic Regions May Play a Large Influence

Because a property is often valued according to its location, another high priority to analyze is geographic neighborhoods. 

If possible, a map will be created in Jupyter across which many types of analyses and heat maps can be performed.

Visualizing the data geographically may assist in understanding. If necessary, the study can approach the visualization using .svg formatted map files, creating heat maps using alpha fill commands.

### Post-Processing Observations

## Progress Log

#### August 6-7, 2020

Read through each feature, collected a data sample and provided reasoning for how the data might be used.

Next step is to break down the data by subsamples according to property type (agricultural, commercial, etc.).

#### August 7, 2020

The total number of commercial properties is only 9.

This is not enough data to perform multivariable regression, and commercial property is too different in terms of sale price and type to be included in the set.

All properties of type C (all) are now dropped.

#### August 25, 2020

I spent my available time over the last few weeks reading through other texts on pandas and numpy. After having improved my understanding of this Jupyter interface, I now return to predicting these housing prices.

I'm making a flow chart that breaks down the data into several areas.

The first area takes all hard numerical data that is ubiquitous across all data and creates a preliminary linear regression.

The second area goes through key non-numerical data, calculates how each data type theoretically and on average changes the value of a property type, and applies that to the target.

The third area goes through all remaining data types, one by one, and adjusts the target price according to the intricacies found in the data.

This results in a final price prediction for each data type.

## Id

An arbitrary index number.

#### Data Sample

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### Reasoning

The `id` is an arbitrary number assigned to each sample. There is no reason to suspect that the target is dependent on this feature value. 

#### Verdict

Keep for submission purposes, but otherwise can be ignored.





## MSSubClass

Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale.  

#### Data Sample

```
 20	1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES
 30	1-STORY 1945 & OLDER
 40	1-STORY W/FINISHED ATTIC ALL AGES
 45	1-1/2 STORY - UNFINISHED ALL AGES
 50	1-1/2 STORY FINISHED ALL AGES
 60	2-STORY 1946 & NEWER
 70	2-STORY 1945 & OLDER
 75	2-1/2 STORY ALL AGES
 80	SPLIT OR MULTI-LEVEL
 85	SPLIT FOYER
 90	DUPLEX - ALL STYLES AND AGES
120	1-STORY PUD (Planned Unit Development) - 1946 & NEWER
150	1-1/2 STORY PUD - ALL AGES
160	2-STORY PUD - 1946 & NEWER
180	PUD - MULTILEVEL - INCL SPLIT LEV/FOYER
190	2 FAMILY CONVERSION - ALL STYLES AND AGES
```

#### Reasoning

While this is a valuable feature, the numerical values are too arbitrary in their assignment to be useful for regression techniques.  

#### Verdict

Keep, for now. 





## MSZoning

Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale.

#### Data Sample

```
A	Agriculture
C	Commercial
FV	Floating Village Residential
I	Industrial
RH	Residential High Density
RL	Residential Low Density
RP	Residential Low Density Park
RM	Residential Medium Density
```

#### Reasoning

This type of data is useful for selecting subsamples.

There would appear to be little point measuring agricultural property against residential property.

One option is to narrow down the sample size further to keep only residential properties or otherwise, and delete everything else.

Upon inspection of the data, there appears to be only residential and commercial property. 

How we price the commerical property may change.

#### Verdict

Keep (for now)





## LotFrontage

#### Data Sample

Linear feet of street connected to property 

```
65.0
80.0
68.0
60.0
84.0
```

#### Reasoning

This is a simple numerical value that is useful for comparing the amount of street connected to the sale price.

#### Verdict

Keep





## LotArea

Lot size in square feet.

#### Data Sample

```
8450
9600
11250
9550
14260
```

#### Reasoning

This is a simple numerical value that applies across all relevant samples within any particular subsample.


#### Verdict

Keep





## Street

Type of road access to property.

#### Data Sample

```
Grvl	Gravel
Pave	Paved
```

#### Reasoning

Paved verses gravel street type is likely to have a large impact on sale price. 

This must be converted to a binary value.

#### Verdict

Keep (convert to binary) 





## Alley

Type of alley access to property

#### Data Sample

```
Grvl	Gravel
Pave	Paved
NA 	No alley access
```

#### Reasoning

This is similar to the Street feature, but for alleys. Not all houses have alleys, and therefore this may only rarely be useful.

#### Verdict

Keep (for now)





## LotShape

General shape of property

#### Data Sample

```
Reg	Regular
IR1	Slightly irregular
IR2	Moderately Irregular
IR3	Irregular
```

#### Reasoning

This is too arbitrary to be useful here.

#### Verdict

Keep for now





## LandContour

Flatness of the property.

#### Data Sample

```
Lvl	Near Flat/Level
Bnk	Banked - Quick and significant rise from street grade to building
HLS	Hillside - Significant slope from side to side
Low	Depression
```

#### Reasoning

Too arbitrary for numerical use cases at this time.

#### Verdict

Delete





## Utilities

Type of utilities available

#### Data Sample

```
AllPub	All public Utilities (E,G,W,& S)
NoSewr	Electricity, Gas, and Water (Septic Tank)
NoSeWa	Electricity and Gas Only
ELO	    Electricity only
```

#### Reasoning

Although arbitrarily designated, the type of utilities avaialble at a property likely have a large influence on the sale price.

#### Verdict

Keep (for now)





## LotConfig

Lot configuration.

#### Data Sample

```
Inside	Inside lot
Corner	Corner lot
CulDSac	Cul-de-sac
FR2	Frontage on 2 sides of property
FR3	Frontage on 3 sides of property
```

#### Reasoning

The configuration may have a large impact on various types of properties, especially commerical.

#### Verdict

Keep (for now)





## LandSlope

Slope of property.

#### Data Sample

```
Gtl	Gentle slope
Mod	Moderate Slope
Sev	Severe Slope
```

#### Reasoning

This would have a large impact on sale price for certain types of property.

#### Verdict

Keep (for now)





## Neighborhood

(Similar to boroughs.)

#### Data Sample

```
Blmngtn	Bloomington Heights
Blueste	Bluestem

SWISU	South & West of Iowa State University
Sawyer	Sawyer
SawyerW	Sawyer West
Somerst	Somerset
StoneBr	Stone Brook
Timber	Timberland
Veenker	Veenker
```

#### Reasoning

The neighborhood is likely to have a large impact on sale prices, especially among residential types.

#### Verdict

Keep




## Condition1

Proximity to various conditions.

#### Data Sample

```
Artery	Adjacent to arterial street
Feedr	Adjacent to feeder street
Norm	Normal
RRNn	Within 200' of North-South Railroad

PosN	Near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc.
PosA	Adjacent to postive off-site feature
RRNe	Within 200' of East-West Railroad
RRAe	Adjacent to East-West Railroad
```

#### Reasoning

While this is likely useful for some subsamples, overall, the residential area already defined above is probably more than sufficient for analytical purposes.  

#### Verdict

Delete




## Condition2

Proximity to various conditions (if more than one is present).

#### Data Sample

```
Artery	Adjacent to arterial street
Feedr	Adjacent to feeder street
Norm	Normal
